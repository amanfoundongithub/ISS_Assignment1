To Run Q1.sh
------------
Q1.sh has two parts a and b. Both of these are added in different files Q1a.sh and Q1b.sh.
<br>
_FOR PART A:_
<br>
Suppose the file in which you want to remove empty spaces is, say `temp.txt`.
<br>
Then on the command line, you have to write<br>
>./Q1a.sh <path of `temp.txt`>
<br>
The output will be that temp.txt has all spaces removed.
<br><br>
_FOR PART B:_ 
<br>
Part B has same instructions as part A. 

To Run Q2.sh
----
To run Q2.sh, suppose the target file is `quotes.txt`.<br>
Then, type this on the command line:<br>
<br>
>./Q2.sh <path of `quotes.txt`>
<br>
The output will be displayed in a file `speech.txt`. If it is not there, one will be created.<br>

To Run Q3.sh
---
Q3.sh has 5 parts, and each of them has got a seperate file.<br>
But to run any of them, you have to give the same input format:
<br>
>./Q3a,b,c,d,e.sh <path of the `file`>
<br>
The output will be displayed on the terminal.

To Run Q4.sh
---
Use this on command line:<br>
>./Q4.sh

The input for `Q4.sh` must be present as the space seperated list of integers.<br><br>
After pressing enter, the sorted array will be displayed on the terminal itself. <br>

To Run Q5.sh
---
All the parts of Q5 (a,b,c) have been included in a single `Q5.sh`.<br>
To run the command for Q5, use the command 
>./Q5.sh
<br>
After this, input the string on which you want to do modification.<br>
The output(s) of the parts will be displayed correspondingly.<br>
